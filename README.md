This work is part of a graduate thesis to modernize the Galbraith-Rupray 
algorithm on equivalence classes instead of the exponential part of 
the Gaudry-Schost algorithm for counting points of a curve of genus 2.
The work was developed and provided in 2022 specifically for the  
Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University.

GRA is a software implementation of the Glabright-Rupray algorithm with some  
modifications that eliminate the problematic side-to-side walking.  

GRAT - parallel version of GRA.
